# WSL Spoiler-Free App

## Project Overview

Welcome to the WSL Spoiler-Free App! This project aims to provide users with a platform to follow the Women's Super League (WSL) without encountering spoilers for specific teams or matches. Users will be able to hide spoilers before entering the app, ensuring they can enjoy news and match videos without any unwanted information.

## Current Status

This project is currently in the early stages of development. So far, the React skeleton has been set up, and two scripts have been created:
1. **News Script**: Fetches the latest news from The Guardian's Women's Football page.
2. **Videos Script**: Retrieves videos from the Everything Women's Football YouTube channel.

## Future Features

The following features are planned for future development:
- **Spoiler Hiding**: Allow users to select specific teams or matches to hide spoilers for.
- **News Viewing**: Browse and read the latest news articles related to WSL.
- **Full Match Videos**: Watch full match videos from the Everything Women's Football YouTube channel.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface with React components for seamless navigation and interaction.
